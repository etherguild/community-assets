# Ether Guild Community Project Artifacts

![Coat of Arms](images/coat-of-arms-demo.png)

This repository contains artifacts and source code for the Ether Guild cryptocurrency community project. It is primarily intended to store source files for 3D printed swag, images, and related materials.

## Structure
- `models/` — Finished 3D model files (STL) for prototypes and printable swag. Current models include:
  - Ether Guild badge designed for a bracelet or wristwatch-style strap ("oathband" prototypes)
  - Other badge and bracelet prototypes
- `images/` — Renders, logos, and reference images
- `src/` — Source files for artifact creation. Currently contains:
  - An OpenSCAD file for the Ether Guild logo on a "Ether Guild" badge background (badge-v001.scad)

Feel free to contribute new designs, scripts, or ideas for Ether Guild swag! If you have new badge or band concepts, add your SCAD or STL files to the appropriate directory.
