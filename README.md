# EtherGuild Community Project Artifacts

![Code of Arms](images/code_of_arms.png)

This repository contains artifacts and source code for the EtherGuild cryptocurrency community project. It is primarily intended to store source files for 3D printed swag, images, and related materials.

## Structure
- `models/` — Finished 3D model files (STL) for prototypes and printable swag. Current models include:
  - EtherGuild badge designed for a bracelet or wristwatch-style strap ("oathband" prototypes)
  - Other badge and bracelet prototypes
- `images/` — Renders, logos, and reference images
- `src/` — Source files for artifact creation. Currently contains:
  - An OpenSCAD file for the EtherGuild logo on a "EtherGuild" badge background (badge-v001.scad)

Feel free to contribute new designs, scripts, or ideas for EtherGuild swag! If you have new badge or band concepts, add your SCAD or STL files to the appropriate directory.
